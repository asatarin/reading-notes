## Javascript Notes

*What is Javascript?*

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

Example
var x = 5;

var y = 6;

var z = x + y;

or

let x = 5;

let y = 6;

let z = x + y;
