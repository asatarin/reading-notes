## HTML
*(HyperText Markup Language)*
 

The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
HTML is the foundation of all web pages. 
Without HTML, you wouldnâ€™t be able to organize text or add images or videos to your web pages. 
HTML is the beginning of everything you need to know to create engaging web pages!
