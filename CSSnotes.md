## CSS Notes

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. 
It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.
CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. 
It is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
Now letâ€™s try to break the acronym:

        > Cascading: Falling of Styles
        > Style: Adding designs/Styling our HTML tags
        > Sheets: Writing our style in different document
 

Selector {
Property 1 : value;
Property 2 : value;
Property 3 : value;
}


For example:
h1
{
Color: red;
Text-align: center;
}

#unique
{
color: green;
}
