## The Coder's Computer

<body>
A text editor is a computer program that lets a user enter, change, store, and usually print text (characters and numbers, each encoded by the computer and its input and output devices, arranged to have meaning to users or to other programs). All computers come with text editors built-in. If you’re on a PC, then your built-in text editor is Notepad. If you’re on a Mac, there’s no program exclusively designed for writing code. However, you can set up TextEdit to work as a text editor by going into Preferences and selecting the Plain Text radio button.

 

**Notepad++**
A free and open-source code editor for Windows, designed to be a replacement for the limited Notepad.

**Adobe Dreamweaver**
This text editor is for the purpose of designing and building websites, using HTML and CSS. It’s powerful and well-liked, but it’s costly too.

**TextMate**
A popular text editor for Mac OS X. Similar to Sublime Text.

**Vim**
This is a popular text editor among many seasoned coders, but perhaps not the right one for a total beginner.

 

*Bare-bones text editors like Notepad don’t have much functionality at all – they let you write text and that’s it.*
*It’s almost like writing with pen and paper.*

- find text and replace it with other text
- highlight syntax (display different types of code in different colors)
- indent lines automatically
- tell you when there’s an error with your code
- open multiple files in tabs
- create and delete files inside folders
- type in multiple places at once (yes, really)
