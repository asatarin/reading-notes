I am Brentice Loper or *John* when I order Starbucks. I was in the Navy for five years and now i'm trying to learn a little something about computers. I've always loved computers and now we get the oppertunity to get to know a little more about them.

### Growth Mindset

To me it is taking on a challenge and seeing it as an oppertunity to grow; even in failure.
Failure is just another chance to try again and make it better.

How do I keep myself in a growth midnset?
1. *I remind myself that comparing myself to someone else never changes my productivity.*
2. *Making sure I stay positive about the outcomes of my work.*
3. *Keeping a level head when taking on new challenges, no matter how big or small.*
